## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Load the farmersmarket.db and browse its content
- Create a logical data model

<br>
If this is your first time in DB Browser for SQLite, the following instructions may help:

#### 1) Load Database
- Open DB Browser for SQLite
- Go to File > Open Database
- Navigate to your farmersmarket.db 
	- This will be wherever you cloned the GH Repo (within the **05_src/sql** folder)
	- ![db_browser_for_sqlite_choose_db.png](./images/01_db_browser_for_sqlite_choose_db.png)

#### 2) Configure your windows
By default, DB Browser for SQLite has three windows, with four tabs in the main window and three tabs in the bottom right window
- Window 1: Main Window (Centre)
	- Stay in the Database Structure tab for now
- Window 2: Edit Database Cell (Top Right)
- Window 3: Remote (Bottom Right)
	- Switch this to DB Schema tab (very bottom)

Your screen should look like this (or very similar)
![db_browser_for_sqlite.png](./images/01_db_browser_for_sqlite.png)

#### 3) The farmersmarket.db
There are 10 tables in the Main Window:
1) booth
2) customer
3) customer_purchases
4) market_date_info
5) product
6) product_category
7) vendor
8) vendor_booth_assignments
9) vendor_inventory
10) postal_data

Switch to the Browse Data tab, booth is selected by default

Using the table drop down at the top left, explore some of the contents of the database

<img src="./images/01_the_table_drop_down_at_the_top_left.png" width="200">

Move on to the Logical Data Model task when you have looked through the tables


### Build Logical Data Model

Recall during session 1:

I diagramed the following four tables:
- product
- product_category
- vendor
- vendor_inventory

 <img src="./images/01_farmers_market_logical_model_partial.png" width="500">


#### Prompt 1:
Choose two tables and create a logical data model. There are lots of tools you can do this (including drawing this by hand), but I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/). 

A logical data model must contain:
- table name
- column names
- relationship type

Please do not pick the exact same tables that I have already diagrammed. For example, you shouldn't diagram the relationship between `product` and `product_category`, but you could diagram `product` and `customer_purchases`.

**HINTS**:
- You will need to use the Browse Data tab in the main window to figure out the relationship types.
- You can't diagram tables that don't share a common column
	- These are the tables that are connected
	- <img src="./images/01_farmers_market_conceptual_model.png" width="600">
- The column names can be found in a few spots (DB Schema window in the bottom right, the Database Structure tab in the main window by expanding each table entry, at the top of the Browse Data tab in the main window)

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 2*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment1.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment1.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### SELECT
1. Write a query that returns everything in the customer table.
2. Write a query that displays all of the columns and 10 rows from the customer table, sorted by customer_last_name, then customer_first_ name.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### WHERE
1. Write a query that returns all customer purchases of product IDs 4 and 9.
2. Write a query that returns all customer purchases and a new calculated column 'price' (quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty), filtered by customer IDs between 8 and 10 (inclusive) using either:
	1.  two conditions using AND
	2.  one condition using BETWEEN

<div align="center">-</div>

#### CASE
1. Products can be sold by the individual unit or by bulk measures like lbs. or oz. Using the product table, write a query that outputs the `product_id` and `product_name` columns and add a column called `prod_qty_type_condensed` that displays the word “unit” if the `product_qty_type` is “unit,” and otherwise displays the word “bulk.”

2. We want to flag all of the different types of pepper products that are sold at the market. Add a column to the previous query called `pepper_flag` that outputs a 1 if the product_name contains the word “pepper” (regardless of capitalization), and otherwise outputs 0.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### JOIN
1. Write a query that `INNER JOIN`s the `vendor` table to the `vendor_booth_assignments` table on the `vendor_id` field they both have in common, and sorts the result by `vendor_name`, then `market_date`.

***

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 3*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment1.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment1.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### AGGREGATE
1. Write a query that determines how many times each vendor has rented a booth at the farmer’s market by counting the vendor booth assignments per `vendor_id`.
2. The Farmer’s Market Customer Appreciation Committee wants to give a bumper sticker to everyone who has ever spent more than $2000 at the market. Write a query that generates a list of customers for them to give stickers to, sorted by last name, then first name.
   
**HINT**: This query requires you to join two tables, use an aggregate function, and use the HAVING keyword.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Temp Table
1. Insert the original vendor table into a temp.new_vendor and then add a 10th vendor: Thomass Superfood Store, a Fresh Focused store, owned by Thomas Rosenthal
   
**HINT**: This is two total queries -- first create the table from the original, then insert the new 10th vendor. When inserting the new vendor, you need to appropriately align the columns to be inserted (there are five columns to be inserted, I've given you the details, but not the syntax)

To insert the new row use VALUES, specifying the value you want for each column:  
`VALUES(col1,col2,col3,col4,col5)`

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Date
1. Get the customer_id, month, and year (in separate columns) of every purchase in the customer_purchases table.
   
**HINT**: you might need to search for strfrtime modifers sqlite on the web to know what the modifers for month and year are!

2. Using the previous query as a base, determine how much money each customer spent in April 2022. Remember that money spent is `quantity*cost_to_customer_per_qty`.
   
**HINTS**: you will need to AGGREGATE, GROUP BY, and filter...but remember, STRFTIME returns a STRING for your WHERE statement!!

**What values systems are embedded in databases and data systems you encounter in your day-to-day life?**

Consider, for example, concepts of fariness, inequality, social structures, marginalization, intersection of technology and society, etc.


```
In the article "When Databases Get to Define Family," we learn how Pakistan's digital ID system, run by NADRA, encodes social norms and power structures into its database design. The system requires each person to link their identity to a verified family structure, such as a married couple and their children. If the data does not match that expected family pattern, access is blocked. As a result, people whose parents are unmarried or whose family structure falls outside the nuclear family model struggle to access basic services like bus tickets or banking simply because the system cannot accommodate their lives.

This story encourages reflection on the often invisible value systems embedded in databases and data systems we encounter every day. Below I explore three areas: fairness and marginalization, social structure and normalization, and the intersection of technology and society.

First, fairness and marginalization. The NADRA example demonstrates how a technical system can unfairly exclude people. Because the database assumes a married parent family model, those in nontraditional families, such as single mothers, orphans, or individuals with gender identities outside the norm, are disadvantaged. They must provide extra proof, or they are arbitrarily blocked. This is a form of structural inequality built into the design. In our daily data systems, such as bank account applications, university registration forms, or health records, similar patterns exist. For example, forms that assume a mother and father rather than parent one and parent two, systems that assume only binary gender categories, or systems that require familial ties for eligibility all risk treating certain people as exceptions rather than equals. The implicit values here are that the standard family, binary gender, and documented proof of relationships are necessary. People who fall outside these norms are marginalized.

Second, social structure and normalization. Databases do not simply record reality; they also assume what should be. In the NADRA system, the database schema reflects a worldview in which everyone should be connected to a family tree of blood or marriage. The family unit is expected to be stable, and children derive identity through their mother or father. This design normalizes certain family types and treats others as errors or edge cases. When a schema defines what counts as valid, it also defines what counts as legitimate. In everyday data systems, this appears in many forms. Driver’s license forms assume a first name and last name, social media profiles assume a single gender field, and police databases assume male or female. These design choices reflect cultural and institutional values about identity, family, and citizenship. They are not neutral.

Third, the intersection of technology and society. The article emphasizes that technical choices, such as schema design, are social and political decisions. The schema of NADRA is a technical artifact that inherits colonial, patriarchal, and citizenship logics. For example, it requires descent from a Pakistani citizen born before a specific date. Technology becomes a site where social structures are enforced. A database may appear technical, but it enforces rules about who counts as a citizen, who gets services, and whose identity is recognized. In our own lives, we interact with many data systems, such as university registration portals, e-commerce accounts, and health databases. When these systems embed assumptions about age, language, gender identity, or family status, they can reproduce marginalization. The value system may prioritize efficiency, standardization, or risk avoidance, but these priorities can conflict with inclusivity, fairness, and recognition of diversity.

In my own experience, I notice forms that ask for a mother’s maiden name, assuming a woman changed her surname, or forms that only allow male or female options, or systems that require proof of a spouse to claim certain benefits. These design choices reflect assumptions about gender, family, and marriage. People who do not fit these assumptions face friction. Another example is a health portal that asks for next of kin formatted as father, mother, or sibling, instead of allowing chosen family or nontraditional family structures. The embedded values are biologically defined family, heteronormative marriage, and linear parent-child relationships. Most users rarely pause to ask why a system is structured this way, who it might exclude, or what assumptions are being built in. The article reminds us that these are not technical necessities; they are choices.

The implications are clear. If databases carry value systems, designers, engineers, and policymakers must make those values explicit and subject to critique. Questions to ask include: Are systems designed to assume a standard family, thereby excluding others? Are they designed to recognize nontraditional families, single parents, or gender diversity? Are they designed for fairness so access is not contingent on fitting a schema? Are we aware of how identity systems create winners and losers?

The article suggests that the solution is not merely patching edge cases but redesigning systems with flexibility and inclusivity in mind. Data systems are not neutral; they carry value systems about who counts, how relationships are defined, and what identity means. Recognizing this is the first step toward designing more just and inclusive systems.```
