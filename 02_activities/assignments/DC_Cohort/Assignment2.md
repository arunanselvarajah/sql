## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*, but you may want to wait until you feel comfortable wtih basic SQL query writing. 

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Design a logical data model
- Duplicate the logical data model and add another table to it following the instructions
- Write, within this markdown file, an answer to Prompt 3


###  Design a Logical Model

#### Prompt 1
Design a logical model for a small bookstore. 📚

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. 

Additionally, include a date table. 

There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

**HINT:** You do not need to create any data for this prompt. This is a conceptual model only. 

#### Prompt 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

#### Prompt 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2? 

**HINT:** search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions. 

```
CUSTOMER_ADDRESS (Type 1) - Overwrite
-------------------------
address_id (PK)
customer_id (FK)
street
city
province
postal_code


CUSTOMER_ADDRESS (Type 2) - Historical
-------------------------
address_key (PK)
customer_id (FK)
street
city
province
postal_code
effective_start_date
effective_end_date
is_current_flag


```

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 4*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question


### Write SQL

#### COALESCE
1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:
```
SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product
```

But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a blank for the first column with nulls, and 'unit' for the second column with nulls. 

**HINT**: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. All the other rows will remain the same.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Windowed Functions
1. Write a query that selects from the customer_purchases table and numbers each customer’s visits to the farmer’s market (labeling each market date with a different number). Each customer’s first visit is labeled 1, second visit is labeled 2, etc. 

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on each new market date for each customer, or select only the unique market dates per customer (without purchase details) and number those visits. 

**HINT**: One of these approaches uses ROW_NUMBER() and one uses DENSE_RANK().

2. Reverse the numbering of the query from a part so each customer’s most recent visit is labeled 1, then write another query that uses this one as a subquery (or temp table) and filters the results to only the customer’s most recent visit.

3. Using a COUNT() window function, include a value along with each row of the customer_purchases table that indicates how many different times that customer has purchased that product_id.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### String manipulations
1. Some product names in the product table have descriptions like "Jar" or "Organic". These are separated from the product name with a hyphen. Create a column using SUBSTR (and a couple of other commands) that captures these, but is otherwise NULL. Remove any trailing or leading whitespaces. Don't just use a case statement for each product! 

| product_name               | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

**HINT**: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. 

2. Filter the query to show any product_size value that contain a number with REGEXP. 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UNION
1. Using a UNION, write a query that displays the market dates with the highest and lowest total sales.

**HINT**: There are a possibly a few ways to do this query, but if you're struggling, try the following: 1) Create a CTE/Temp Table to find sales values grouped dates; 2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create "best day" and "worst day"; 3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day, with a UNION binding them.

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 5*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### Cross Join
1. Suppose every vendor in the `vendor_inventory` table had 5 of each of their products to sell to **every** customer on record. How much money would each vendor make per product? Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

**HINT**: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)? How many customers are there (y). Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x\*y). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### INSERT
1. Create a new table "product_units". This table will contain only products where the `product_qty_type = 'unit'`. It should use all of the columns from the product table, as well as a new column for the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.  Name the timestamp column `snapshot_timestamp`.

2. Using `INSERT`, add a new row to the product_unit table (with an updated timestamp). This can be any product you desire (e.g. add another record for Apple Pie). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### DELETE 
1. Delete the older record for the whatever product you added.

**HINT**: If you don't specify a WHERE clause, [you are going to have a bad time](https://imgflip.com/i/8iq872).

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UPDATE
1. We want to add the current_quantity to the product_units table. First, add a new column, `current_quantity` to the table using the following syntax.
```
ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;
```

Then, using `UPDATE`, change the current_quantity equal to the **last** `quantity` value from the vendor_inventory details. 

**HINT**: This one is pretty hard. First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) Third, `SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...)`, remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, you'll need to use `product_units.product_id` to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement.

### Ethics

Read: Boykis, V. (2019, October 16). _Neural nets are just people all the way down._ Normcore Tech. <br>
    https://vicki.substack.com/p/neural-nets-are-just-people-all-the

**What are the ethical issues important to this story?**

Consider, for example, concepts of labour, bias, LLM proliferation, moderating content, intersection of technology and society, ect. 


```
Vicki Boykis’ article “Neural nets are just people all the way down” provides a clear reminder that artificial intelligence, no matter how sophisticated it seems, is built entirely on human labor and human choices. AI systems, particularly neural networks, are often perceived as autonomous or magical, but their foundations are deeply human. Every dataset, every label, every classification is the product of people making decisions. Understanding this shifts the conversation about AI from one of purely technical challenges to one of ethics, fairness, and accountability.

A central ethical issue is labor. Modern machine learning systems rely on massive datasets that must be cleaned, labeled, and curated by humans. ImageNet, one of the most famous datasets in AI research, contains millions of images manually labeled by thousands of people using platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk. This work is often low paid, invisible, and emotionally taxing. Boykis draws attention to the fact that while AI feels automated, it actually depends on extensive human effort behind the scenes. Recognizing this labor is important because it raises questions about fairness, compensation, and the social costs of technology.

Bias is another major concern. AI systems learn from human data, and that data reflects existing societal inequalities, stereotypes, and assumptions. If a dataset overrepresents certain groups or includes mislabeled or offensive content, AI can reinforce or amplify these biases. The example of ImageNet Roulette, where people were mislabeled with inappropriate or offensive terms, demonstrates how seemingly small errors in human labeling can have wide-reaching consequences. Ethical AI design must include strategies to detect, prevent, and correct bias, and it must consider who is making the labeling decisions and how those decisions influence the system.

The proliferation of AI also presents ethical challenges. Large language models and neural networks require enormous computational power and resources, often concentrated in the hands of a few corporations or institutions. This concentration of power raises questions about who controls AI, who benefits from it, and who bears the risks. Additionally, AI is deployed in high-stakes contexts like facial recognition, content moderation, and decision making in healthcare or hiring, where errors or bias can have serious real-world consequences.

Transparency and accountability are essential ethical considerations. Since AI systems rely on complex layers of data, models, and human input, it can be difficult to trace decisions or explain outcomes. When AI misclassifies or causes harm, responsibility cannot rest with the machine. Humans—engineers, data curators, organizations—must remain accountable. Boykis emphasizes that understanding the human foundations of AI is necessary for creating systems that are fair, responsible, and socially aware.

Finally, the article highlights the intersection of technology and society. AI is not neutral. It embodies human choices, labor practices, and cultural assumptions. Whether it is classifying images, moderating content, or providing recommendations, AI reflects and shapes social values. Ethical engagement with AI therefore requires careful reflection on how data is collected, how models are trained, and how outputs are used. It also requires ongoing oversight and a commitment to correct mistakes, just as the ImageNet team began manually addressing offensive labels in the person subtree of their dataset.

In sum, Boykis’ message is both simple and profound. Neural networks are not autonomous systems acting independently. They are human creations built layer by layer on human work and judgment. Ethical AI cannot be achieved through technology alone. It demands recognition of human labor, careful attention to bias, transparency in decision making, accountability for outcomes, and awareness of the social and cultural impacts of the systems we build.```
